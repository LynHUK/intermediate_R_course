## Test your understanding

```{r total_attendance, echo=FALSE}

learnr::question_numeric("What is the total attendance accross the 5 rows with the lowest attendances?",
answer("15", correct = TRUE),
correct = "Correct! 

You can use code similar to 
> q1_df<- slice_min(data, n=5, order_by = breaches)

> sum(q1_df$attendances)

to get the total.",
try_again = "Incorrect. Use ?slice to look at the help file to find the function you need to get a small dataframe of the 5 rows with the lowest attendance. You can then use sum() to get the total of the attendances column.",
allow_retry = TRUE)
```
